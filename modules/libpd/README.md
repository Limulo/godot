#README

This module is intended to use libpd as audio engine within godot.

A copy of libpd (`libpd_wrapper`, `libpd_wrapper/util`, `pure-data/src`, `pure-data/extra`) can be found inside **thirdparty** folder.

The **SConstruct** file has been modified (a reference to builtin libpd has been added).
